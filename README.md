Test task to implement JSON:API client
### Disclaimer:

Here are a few things I didn't use in the current task. But I always(or almost always) use it in real projects:

* use ENV variables to pass sensitive data
* lock gems version(according to rules of a specific project)
* model validation
* rubocop
* current application available in development mode only
